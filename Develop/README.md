# Employee Information Storage Page
    This application stores and renders employee information onto an html file after information is submitted through a series of prompts using Inquirer. 
    
    The employee information has three possible positions: manager, engineer, and intern. The user can add as many of each position as s/he needs. 

    The information prompts are as follows:
        Manager: name, id, email, and office number
        Engineer: name, id, email, and github username
        Intern: name, id, email, and school name.

    Each will be displayed on the rendered html file with all the information input through the terminal prompts.
